## Libraries Used

* [FLask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
A microframework to basically connect our python code with web interface.

* [Plot.Ly](https://plot.ly/python)
A visualization library for python which supports both python and javascript.

## Bottleneck
IMDBPY api primarily takes the majority of time in retrieving the data but hey, it's a free service and provides everything for free. Donate a little there if possible.
